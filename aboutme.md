My name is Connell McGinley.

I live in Belfast, N.Ireland. I work in IT and have been enjoying learning about Cyber Security & Azure.

I decided to create this site with some blog posts about my journey through learning Azure & Cyber Security, as well as other stuff.

In December 2019, I completed Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) and in January 2020, I completed Azure Security (AZ-500).

I am currently studying for Azure Administrator (AZ-104).
